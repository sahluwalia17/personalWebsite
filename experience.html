	<img src="images/shiftleft.png" class = "sidepic-1" style = "float:left">
		<p align = "justify" class = "exp-1">Description: Part of the Runtime Infrastructure Team<br><br>
		Notable Aspects: <br>
		- Usage of Docker: building images, running containers, and working with .yaml files <br>
		- Worked heavily on Wildebeest, a Shiftleft application that performs end-to-end testing of its services, by adding more tests, testing features, resolving issues, and increasing optimization of application runtime <br>
		- Other resources were the Github repository pipeline and the Dockerhub repositories<br></p>

	<h2 class="experience-align">ShieldX Software Engineer Intern</h2>
	<img src="images/shieldx.jpg" class = "sidepic-2" style = "float:right">
		<p align = "justify" class = "exp-2">Description: Developed a command life interface in Python that allows the user to interact with the ShieldX API<br><br>
		Notable Aspects:<br>
		- Made of seven files: one file that outputs all information to the user; one file to store all the data that the user requests for; and five other files to interact with the API and retrieve information<br>
		- Implemented login system that requires user to specify IP address, username, and password to access the CLI’s functions<br>
		- Regular expressions were utilized in order for the user to have quick autocompletion of commands<br>
		- Requests module was used to make GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests<br>
		- JSON module was used to interpret data received from requests<br>
		- ContextLib module was used to open/close connections to the API</p>

	<img src="images/walldrop.png" class = "sidepic-1" style = "float:left">
		<p align = "justify" class = "exp-1">Description: Developed an executable application that prompts the user to login with their Spotify account, and returns a wallpaper made up of 18 of their top track's album covers. <br><br>

		Notable Aspects:<br>
		- With user authorization, the program makes requests to the Spotify API and we request 50 of their top tracks as to ensure no repeats<br>
		- Parses the API response for the urls for 300 x 300 pixel pictures of the album cover of a specific track<br>
		- Program automatically downloads all of the urls for the 18 unique songs and uses a module known as PIL to stich together all of the images<br>
		- Wallpaper is downloaded to the directory in which the program is executed</p>

		Notable Aspects:<br>
		- Implemented the design approach of the ShieldX project (this code is made publicly available unlike the ShieldX CLI)<br>
		- Features the BeautifulSoup4 module for lightweight parsing of an NBA stats website in which data was gathered from<br>
		- Utilizes a module called py2exe in order to store entire Python file into a .exe file so user does not need Python to run</p>

		Notable Aspects:<br>
		Android Programming using Android Studio<br>
		Usage of the Android package OkHttp to make requests to Spotify and an online API called YoutubeToMp3API<br>
		Algorithm: Parses Spotify link to retrieve song name -> uses song name to make a Youtube query and retrieve the video that most correlates with the song name -> sends Youtube link to YoutubeToMp3 API -> Downloads the video as an MP3</p>
