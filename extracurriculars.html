		- Regular expressions were utilized in order for the user to have quick autocompletion of commands<br>
		- Requests module was used to make GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests<br>

		Notable Aspects:<br>
		Android Programming using Android Studio<br>
		Usage of the Android package OkHttp to make requests to Spotify and an online API called YoutubeToMp3API<br>
		Algorithm: Parses Spotify link to retrieve song name -> uses song name to make a Youtube query and retrieve the video that most correlates with the song name -> sends Youtube link to YoutubeToMp3 API -> Downloads the video as an MP3</p>
